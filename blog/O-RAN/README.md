## Preface
Before,I had involved in ATCA（Advanced Telecom Computing Architecture）, A try by Intel to enter the telecom market via COTS(Commercial Off-The-Shelf) equipment.
Now time go to cloud in core network, Open interface in RAN.
O-RAN Alliance is proposed by CMCC & other operators.
### main vendor
Intel
Mavenir, 
CertusNet
and some previous antenna vendors

### TIP (Telecom Infra Project)

## progress 
As the RRU is fully specified by 3GPP for the air interface and O-RAN for the RRU to DU interface, MNOs will have the ability to choose best-of-breed components and have the flexibility to choose from an increasing number of RRU and end–to–end vendors. 

The key goals of OpenRAN are: 

Open Interfaces 
* Increased Security 
* Increase RAN technology partner/supplier diversity  
* The RRU architecture is based on O-RAN Alliance Split 7.2 and all bands support 5G NR.


* Protocol stack
