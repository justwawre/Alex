before: 

ameas, pmeas change a<--->p by sis process
if ameas  can't delte

the problem is:sometime the process don't change the ameas to pmeas, but the measurement do need delte


the trick before last serveral years:

return 1: allow delete when customer: why can't delte the dead ameas
return 0 :don't allow delte when customer complain: why the operator delte the active meas


my solution:
check the process then return 0 or 1
